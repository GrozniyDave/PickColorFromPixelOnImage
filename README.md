# PickColorFromPixelOnImage

This little project is all about manipulating canvas, I load the image pixel by pixel on canvas and when cursor hover 
over that image, there is another element that will "zoom in" and show zoomed in , pixelated version of the image field, then
the pixel's color hex code as well as rgb values will show up.
